Project Documentation: Vehicle Management System in C#
1. Project Overview
This project aims to model different types of vehicles (e.g., cars and motorcycles) using object-oriented programming principles in C#. The system categorizes vehicles into two types: Car and Motorcycle. Each vehicle type has unique characteristics such as the number of seats, number of gears, and capacity, which are encapsulated in respective classes.

The project demonstrates the use of key object-oriented concepts, such as enums, interfaces, classes, and polymorphism. The vehicle types implement specific interfaces (IFourWheeler for cars and ITwoWheeler for motorcycles), enabling them to define behavior that is unique to each type.

2. Project Structure
2.1 Enum: VehicleType
Purpose: The VehicleType enum is used to define and categorize the types of vehicles in the system. It helps distinguish between different vehicle types such as cars and motorcycles.

Values:

Car: Represents a vehicle of type Car.
Motorcycle: Represents a vehicle of type Motorcycle.
Usage: The VehicleType enum is used to determine the type of vehicle being created, and helps with factory patterns or decision-making processes regarding vehicle-specific properties or behaviors.

2.2 Interfaces: IFourWheeler and ITwoWheeler
Purpose: Interfaces are used to define contracts that classes implementing them must follow. In this project, the interfaces are used to ensure that vehicles of different types (cars and motorcycles) implement certain properties and methods specific to their category.

IFourWheeler: Interface for vehicles that have four wheels (e.g., cars).

Properties:
NumberOfSeats: Number of seats available in the vehicle.
NumberOfGears: Number of gears the vehicle has.
Capacity: Fuel capacity of the vehicle in liters.
Methods:
DisplayDetails(): Displays the details of the vehicle.
ITwoWheeler: Interface for vehicles that have two wheels (e.g., motorcycles).

Properties:
NumberOfSeats: Number of seats available in the vehicle.
NumberOfGears: Number of gears the vehicle has.
Capacity: Fuel capacity of the vehicle in liters.
Methods:
DisplayDetails(): Displays the details of the vehicle.
Usage: These interfaces ensure that the classes Car and Motorcycle implement the necessary properties and behaviors specific to their type. They allow polymorphic behavior, where the system can handle different vehicle types interchangeably if needed.

2.3 Classes: Car and Motorcycle
Purpose: The Car and Motorcycle classes represent specific vehicle types that are implemented with the respective interfaces (IFourWheeler for Car and ITwoWheeler for Motorcycle).

Car: A class representing a car.
Attributes:
ModelNo: The model number of the car.
YearMade: The year the car was manufactured.
NumberOfGears: The number of gears in the car’s transmission system.
NumberOfSeats: The total number of seats in the car.
Capacity: The fuel capacity of the car in liters.
Methods:
DisplayDetails(): Prints out the details of the car (model number, year made, number of gears, seats, and fuel capacity).
Motorcycle: A class representing a motorcycle.
Attributes:
ModelNo: The model number of the motorcycle.
YearMade: The year the motorcycle was manufactured.
NumberOfGears: The number of gears in the motorcycle’s transmission system.
NumberOfSeats: The total number of seats in the motorcycle.
Capacity: The fuel capacity of the motorcycle in liters.
Methods:
DisplayDetails(): Prints out the details of the motorcycle (model number, year made, number of gears, seats, and fuel capacity).
Usage: The Car and Motorcycle classes contain specific vehicle details and behaviors for each vehicle type. These classes can be extended or modified to include more complex features such as engine type, color, or performance metrics. The DisplayDetails() method is a basic way of showcasing each vehicle's key attributes.

2.4 Factory Design Pattern (Optional)
Purpose: A factory pattern can be used to create instances of Car and Motorcycle dynamically based on the vehicle type.

Explanation:

The VehicleFactory class is designed to create and return instances of Car or Motorcycle based on the VehicleType enum.
This pattern encapsulates the creation logic, allowing the client code to request a vehicle without needing to know the specific class details (e.g., whether it's a Car or Motorcycle).
Benefits:

Reduces tight coupling between the client code and the specific classes (Car or Motorcycle).
Makes the system more extensible, allowing the addition of new vehicle types in the future without changing the client code.
3. Key Concepts Used
3.1 Enums
Enums are used to define a set of related constants. In this case, the VehicleType enum allows the system to easily distinguish between cars and motorcycles, making the code more readable and reducing the risk of errors.
3.2 Interfaces
Interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to. They allow different classes to implement similar behavior while maintaining flexibility and extensibility.
In this project, the IFourWheeler and ITwoWheeler interfaces ensure that the Car and Motorcycle classes provide consistent properties and methods.
3.3 Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface. In this case, both Car and Motorcycle implement their respective interfaces, and the DisplayDetails() method can be used interchangeably on both objects, demonstrating polymorphism.
3.4 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. In this project, the vehicle attributes such as ModelNo, YearMade, NumberOfSeats, etc., are encapsulated within the Car and Motorcycle classes, ensuring that these attributes are accessed and modified only through class methods (such as DisplayDetails()).
3.5 Abstraction
Abstraction allows us to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features to the user. In this system, the user does not need to know how a car or motorcycle is created or stored; they only interact with the DisplayDetails() method, which abstracts the underlying implementation.
4. Future Enhancements
Adding More Vehicle Types: The system could be extended to support other types of vehicles, such as trucks, buses, or electric vehicles, by creating new classes and corresponding interfaces.
Additional Properties and Methods: More detailed properties such as engine type, color, price, and performance metrics could be added to the Car and Motorcycle classes.
Input/Output Handling: The system could be extended to accept user input for vehicle details and display the results dynamically.
Database Integration: A database could be integrated to store and retrieve vehicle details, allowing the system to manage larger fleets of vehicles efficiently.
5. Conclusion
This C# Vehicle Management System demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles such as enums, interfaces, classes, and polymorphism. By using these concepts, the system is structured in a way that is modular, flexible, and easy to extend. The project serves as a foundation for more advanced vehicle management applications that could include additional features like database storage, user input handling, and more complex behaviors for each vehicle type.

Project Overview: Vehicle Management System in C#
This Vehicle Management System is designed to model two types of vehicles: Car and Motorcycle, using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C#. The system categorizes vehicles using an enum, defines common behaviors through interfaces, and encapsulates vehicle-specific details in classes.

Key Components:
Enum: VehicleType

The VehicleType enum is used to distinguish between different vehicle categories, specifically Car and Motorcycle. It simplifies the process of creating and managing vehicles of different types.
Interfaces: IFourWheeler and ITwoWheeler

The IFourWheeler interface defines properties like NumberOfSeats, NumberOfGears, and Capacity that are specific to four-wheeled vehicles (e.g., cars).
The ITwoWheeler interface defines similar properties for two-wheeled vehicles (e.g., motorcycles).
Both interfaces include a DisplayDetails() method to print the vehicle details.
Classes: Car and Motorcycle

Car and Motorcycle classes implement the respective interfaces. Each class holds attributes like ModelNo, YearMade, NumberOfGears, NumberOfSeats, and Capacity.
These classes provide functionality to encapsulate vehicle details and display them using the DisplayDetails() method.
Factory Design Pattern (Optional)

The VehicleFactory class can create instances of Car or Motorcycle based on the VehicleType enum. This factory pattern abstracts the creation logic, making the system more extensible and reducing tight coupling between the client code and vehicle classes.
Key OOP Concepts Used:
Encapsulation: Vehicle attributes are bundled within the Car and Motorcycle classes, controlling access and modification.
Polymorphism: Different vehicle types (car and motorcycle) can be treated uniformly through their shared interfaces, enabling the same method (DisplayDetails()) to be used for both.
Abstraction: Complex details of vehicle implementation are hidden, with users interacting only through simplified methods like DisplayDetails().
