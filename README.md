The Vehicle Management System in C# models Car and Motorcycle using enums, interfaces, and classes. It includes an enum to categorize vehicles, interfaces for common properties, and classes for each vehicle type. The system supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, with optional use of a Factory Pattern for flexible vehicle creation.
